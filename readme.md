# Microcontroller Server
This code implements a wireless server run on the Arduino Portenta H7. Written in pure Micropython and created for learning purposes. This code can be used as the basis for over wifi communication projects.

&nbsp;

## Local Computer Dependencies

This code uses the following libraries:
- `pyb`: pyboard library specific to the hardware used
- `socket`: For handling the system level communication hardware 

&nbsp;

## Run this demo yourself

To run this code you'll need a microcontroller running Micropython that has wifi capabilities and also comes with the pyb library. Arduino has some great resources. 

&nbsp;

## How it Works

The app as follows:
1. The microcontroller connects to the internet
2. Then, the board waits for a client connection
3. After, the board waits or a TCP message
4. Next, the board sends a response "Hello from Portenta"
5. Finally, the code loops
